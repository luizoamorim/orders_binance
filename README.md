This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`]

## Project
Utilizing react, typescript and ChakraUI, recreate the order book from Binance.com

The order book should stream data from Binance API documentations available here: https://binance-docs.github.io/apidocs/spot/en/

The order book should resemble a similar order book on Binance itself.

User should be able to input a pair name, such as BTC/USDT, and it should automatically start streaming the data from their end points. 

## Getting Started

Run the development server:

yarn dev

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

**Insert some pair of criptocurrencies like ETH/BTC or BTC/USDT to see the order book.**

The result of the project:
